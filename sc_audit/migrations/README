# Database Migrations

We use alembic for database migrations.

For the time being, run alembic commands from the ./sc_audit directory. This will not be a good solution for package users. An interface will needed to be provided at a package level.

To migrate your local DB to the latest schema, do:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This command also works when you don't have a local DB yet. It will create the sqlite file for you.
