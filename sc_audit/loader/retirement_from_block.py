"""
Load the relationships between retirements and minted blocks into the DB.

These relationships are implicit in the source data. Both minted blocks and retirements
are associated with serial numbers that specify a range of individual credits. This loader
module iterates over retirement records and finds the minted blocks that match their serial
numbers, storing the explicit relationships.
